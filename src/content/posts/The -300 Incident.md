The background is that my father gave me a bicycle when I moved to Suzhou campus. I liked it, but in most cases, I chose the subway or bus instead of riding it. So, I didn’t maintain it for a long time and just left it in the bike storage area. Recently, I planned to go to KFC for breakfast in the coming days to motivate myself to get up early, and the best way to get there is by bike. So, I found my bicycle this morning and planned to take it to a repair shop. However, since the shop is quite far from my school, I called a Didi taxi.

Then disaster struck: the taxi turned out to be a small car and couldn’t fit my bicycle at all. I tried several times but quickly realized it was impossible. Meanwhile, the driver told me that her car had been damaged in the process. She was a kind person—although she pointed it out, she remained calm and friendly. I felt ashamed and asked how much I should pay to compensate her. She said the damaged part was important and could only be fixed by replacing it entirely, which would cost around 300 yuan. But she also said I could just pay her 50 yuan since I was still a student.

In the end, I paid her 300 yuan because I thought it would be unfair for her to suffer a loss when she did nothing wrong. It wasn’t her fault, and making a living through Didi is really tough. I believed I did the right thing, but 300 yuan is a lot for me as a student. I feel a bit conflicted. One of the biggest reasons I paid the full amount is because I knew I would feel ashamed if I caused trouble and let an innocent person bear the consequences.

So now I’m wondering: am I really paying for my mistake to ease my conscience rather than to make sure she wasn’t upset? Am I still being selfish, and was the driver just a side character who benefited while I was simply trying to make myself feel better?
